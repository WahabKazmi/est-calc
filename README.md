Greetings,

I am pleased to share with you my assesment, a price calculator built using React.js with custom styling. For styling, I used SCSS with functions and variables to ensure a flexible and easily customizable design. To manage the data, I utilized the json-server package and the application runs on port 8080.

Run the following command to run this project

### npx json-server --watch database/db.json --port 8080

### npm i

### npm start

The project was built to meet several requirements. Firstly, I implemented query parameters to allow users to remain on the same tab when they refresh the page. Additionally, the form is generated through a JSON file with a schema that is easily adjustable. The JSON file allows for the addition of new form elements, and easy adjustments to the formula and values of each form element. Two types of elements can be added: a range selector and a radio selector.

Furthermore, I ensured that all of the code is reusable, allowing each component and logic to be reused independently. Finally, I completed the project without using any styling libraries, to maintain flexibility and allow for customization.

I am confident that I have met all of the project requirements. If there is anything that I may have missed, I apologize in advance.

Thank you.
